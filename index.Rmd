### Initial Visualization

```{r}
ggplot(activities, aes(activity_date, distance)) +
  geom_col(aes(color = activity_type))+
  labs(title = "My Strava Logged Activities",
       subtitle = "2016-2021",
       y = "Distance (km)",
       x = "Date",
       caption = "I like to pedal.")+    
  theme_minimal()
```

=====================================  

### Exercise is more frequent, or at least I am tracking it more regularly...
```{r}
plot_calendar(gpxdata, unit = "distance")
```

=====================================     

### A searchable table of my activities

```{r}
activities %>% 
  reactable(
    searchable = TRUE,
    filterable = TRUE,
    columns = list(
      activity_id = colDef(name = "Activity ID"),
      activity_date = colDef(name = "Activity Date"),
      activity_name = colDef(name = "Activity Name"),
      activity_type = colDef(name = "Activity Type"),
      elapsed_time = colDef(name = "Elapsed Time"),
      distance = colDef(name = "Distance (km)"),
      elevation_gain = colDef(name = "Elevation Gain (m)")
    )
  )
```



```{r birds-eye views}
p1 <- plot_facets(gpxdata)
ggsave("plots/facet001.png", p1, width = 20, height = 20, units = "cm")
```

```{r when do I exercise?}
p5 <- plot_ridges(gpxdata)
ggsave("plots/ridges001.png", p5, width = 20, height = 20, units = "cm")
```

```{r am I getting more active?}
p4 <- plot_calendar(gpxdata, unit = "distance")
ggsave("plots/calendar001.png", p4, width = 20, height = 20, units = "cm")
```


```{r eugene routes}
p2 <- plot_map(gpxdata, lon_min = -122.92, lon_max = -123.1, lat_min = 43.88, lat_max = 44.1)
ggsave("plots/map001.png", p2, width = 20, height = 15, units = "cm", dpi = 600)
