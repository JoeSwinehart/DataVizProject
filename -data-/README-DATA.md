# Read me, Seymour!
The Strava GPX dataset associated with this repo is too large to house on GitHub. If you would like to reproduce the plots shown here, you will need to extract the file called JoeStrava.zip which should be in the same folder as the index.RMD file. If for some reason you can't find it, you may download that [necessary file](https://github.com/JoeSwinehart/DataVizProject/raw/main/data/JoeStrava.zip) here. 

Once you have extracted the data, ensure that that the new "data"" folder is in the directory that houses the .Rmd file and things should work just fine...
