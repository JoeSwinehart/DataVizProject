# Read me, Seymour!
The Strava GPX dataset associated with this repo is too large to house on GitHub. If you would like to reproduce the plots shown here, you may download the [enclosed file](https://github.com/JoeSwinehart/DataVizProject/raw/main/data/JoeStrava.zip). Once you have extracted the data, add the data folder to the directory that houses the .Rmd file and things should work just fine.
