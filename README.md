# Data Viz Project
This repo houses my attempt at the course [Final Project](https://dataviz-2021.netlify.app/assignments/#final-project) from the Winter 2021 offering of [EDLD 652](https://dataviz-2021.netlify.app): *Data Visualization for Educational Data Science*, offered through the University of Oregon's College of Education.

In order to successfully run this code, you may need to install a few packages. These lines of code should suffice to make it happen:

install.packages(c("devtools", "mapproj", "tidyverse", "gtools"))

devtools::install_github("marcusvolz/strava")
